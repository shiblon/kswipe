# KSwipe - A Chrome Extension for Dexterity-Challenged Readers

The KSwipe extension (so called because of my friend Krissa, who has cerebral palsy), turns off all touch and click targets on a Kindle reader screen and only accepts definite swipe gestures for page-turning.

It debounces such gestures with extreme prejudice, only allowing a single page turn no matter how long or large the swipe is, never allowing it to go backwards on the same gesture, and enforcing a long cool-down time between swipes.

This makes it possible to swipe with low accuracy and without removing the finger or hand from the screen when going back, but still allowing a normal, single page turn on the reader.
